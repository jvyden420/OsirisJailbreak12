# OsirisJailbreak12
iOS 12.0 -> 12.1.2 Incomplete Jailbreak with CVE-2019-6225

An incomplete iOS 12 Jailbreak. For now it only runs the exploit, gets tfp0, gets ROOT, escapes the SandBox, writes a test file to prove the sandbox was escaped, then resprings the device. 

Feel free to build on top of it as long as you respect the GPLv3 license.

Older (4K) devices are unsupported for now. 16K devices/A12 devices are experimental and may not work.

In order to compile this app, you will need to add `qilin.o` to the project. This can be downloaded from [here.](http://newosxbook.com/QiLin/qilin.o)

### REMEMBER, THIS IS A DEVELOPER JAILBREAK! NOT FOR THE GENERAL PUBLIC.
